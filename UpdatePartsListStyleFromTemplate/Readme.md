# Update Parts List Style From Template

This command changes the Parts List Style according to settings you provide in the file program_settings.txt.  That file has a lot of comments and is meant to be self-explanatory.

Note, there is a one-to-one correspondence between sheet size and parts list style.  If you have more than one parts list style for a given sheet size, this will not work as required.  Please raise an issue on this Repo and we can discuss.
