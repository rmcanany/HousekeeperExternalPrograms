' Program settings

' Blank lines, or those preceeded by a single quote ('), like this one, are ignored.

' You can/must change the variable values, but not their names.
' The variable names appear BEFORE the equals sign (=) their value AFTER.
' The names are used by the program.  It won't work if you change them.
' The variable names are: DraftListPath, BackgroundSheetNames, and PartsListStyleNames.

' In the case of a comma-delimited list, if a variable value itself contains a comma,
' it must be preceeded by a backslash (\) to be interpreted correctly.
' Eg, if the variable value is "ABC-1,1", it must be entered as "ABC-1\,1"

' One more thing about a comma-delimited list.  It can contain many values, or only one.
' It either case a trailing comma is not allowed, for example:
' Incorrect: BackgroundSheetNames = A3-quer, A2-quer, A1-quer, A0-quer,
' Correct:   BackgroundSheetNames = A3-quer, A2-quer, A1-quer, A0-quer

' DRAFTLIST PATH
' This is the file that holds the Parts List Style settings.  A full path to the file is required.
DraftListPath = C:\Program Files\Siemens\Solid Edge 2025\Template\Reports\DraftList.txt

' BACKGROUND SHEET NAMES
' Names of the drawing background sheets that have parts list styles associated with them.
' It is treated as a comma-delimited list, even if there is only one entry.
BackgroundSheetNames = A3-quer, A2-quer, A1-quer, A0-quer

' PARTS LIST STYLE NAMES
' These are the style names that correspond to the background sheets.
' There must be a one-to-one correspondence between the background sheets and their parts style.
' It too is treated as a comma-delimited list, even if there is only one entry.
PartsListStyleNames = T - A3, T - A2, T - A1, T - A0
