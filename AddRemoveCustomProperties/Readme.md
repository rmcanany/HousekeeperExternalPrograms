# AddRemoveCustomProperties

This program adds and/or removes Custom file properties.  Actually, it only removes them.  I didn't get around to the adding part.

You identify which properties to remove in a text file named `properties_to_remove.txt`.  The file must reside in the same directory as the executable.
