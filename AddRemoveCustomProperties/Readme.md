# AddRemoveCustomProperties

This program adds and/or removes Custom file properties. 
Actually, it only removes them.  I didn't get around to the adding part.

You identify which properties to remove in a text file 
named `property_list.txt`.  The file must reside in the 
same directory as the executable.

There are two operating modes for removal. 
One, `OperatingMode Remove` deletes properties that 
ARE on the list.  The other, `OperatingMode RemoveAllExcept`, 
deletes properties that ARE NOT on the list. 
Select the mode in `property_list.txt`.
