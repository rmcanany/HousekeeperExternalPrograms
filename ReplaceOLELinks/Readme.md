# Replace OLE Links

An automated method to replace OLE inserted objects with SE-native blocks in draft files.  It works in conjunction with the `Run External Program` command in Housekeeper.

It's pretty general-purpose and you may be able to use it as-is.  However, if you need to tweak things, feel free.  It's open source after all.

Edit the configuration file, program-settings.txt, to identify the OLE names and their block replacements, and template file that contains the blocks.
